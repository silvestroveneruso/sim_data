# A Model-Based Simulation Tool for Smart Homes

Link to download the three project tools:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMDeY8y_AGmyXg7wsQuyrdM_zOkDw0VK/view?usp=sharing

Inside the google drive folder you will find three tools:
- 'Simulator_v1.0', the main tool which allows to start a simulation in the context of smart homes;
- 'HomeDesigner_v1.0', the tool to design the smart home filled with sensors;
- 'HumanDesigner_v1.0', the tool to create human profiles which characterize the inhabitant(s) within the simulation.

After downloading them, to run each tool, double-click on the corresponding executable (.exe files).

# Simulation Models

The following repository contains models for the 'Simulator_v1.0' tool. In particular:
- 'Acting_models', containing models describing main-events/activities which follow the original language of the simulator;
- 'System_Model', containing models describing main-events/activities which follow the task-model language.

Models from these folders can be integrated within the simulation by adding them to the corresponding folders inside the 'Data' folder already present within the 'Simulator_v1.0' tool.


With this public repository we encourage anyone interested to enrich this folder by adding more and more models over time!
