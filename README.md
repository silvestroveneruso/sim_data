# A Model-Based Simulation Tool for Smart Homes

Link to download the project tools:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMDeY8y_AGmyXg7wsQuyrdM_zOkDw0VK/view?usp=sharing

Inside the google drive folder you will find three tools:
- *Simulator_v1.0*, the main tool to start a simulation run in the context of a smart home;
- *HomeDesigner_v1.0*, the tool to design the smart environment filled with sensors used within the simulation;
- *HumanDesigner_v1.0*, the tool to create human profiles which characterize the inhabitant(s) within the simulation.

After downloading them, to run each tool, double-click on the corresponding executable (*.exe* files).

The repository does not only include the executables needed to run the tool, but also a set of models including human models, house models, acting models and behaviour patterns. The goal of this repository is to provide a shared workspace the community can contribute to. The creation of models is indeed an expensive task, thus the availability of such a repository can speed up the definition of common scenarios to be used to produce workbenches.

# Simulation Models

The following repository contains models for the *Simulator_v1.0* tool. In particular:
- *Acting_models*, containing models describing main-events/activities which follow the original language of the simulator;
- *System_Model*, containing models describing main-events/activities which follow the task-model language.

Models from these folders can be integrated within the simulation by adding them to the corresponding folders inside the *Data* folder already present within the *Simulator_v1.0* tool.
